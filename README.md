# MZ Transfer Alarm
Having played this game for long enough I'm sure you missed a lot of transfers because you forgot them after adding them to shortlist. After missing lots of transfers I finally decided to fix this problem by settings alarms for transfers. I created a browser extension which reads players from your shortlist and lists them in an order by their transfer deadline. From there you can set alarms by selecting players and using buttons at the bottom. Alarm and notification fires up 1 minute before transfer ends.

#### Get the extension
- [For Firefox][firefox]  
- [For Chrome][chrome]

## How to Use
- Add players on transfer page to shortlist.
- Go to shortlist page and click extension icon on toolbar. This will load players at shortlist to extension interface.
- Once you load the players to the extension interface, they will stay there until you close the browser or refresh on shortlist page.
- Click to checkboxes left to the players name and use buttons on bottom to set alarms, clear alarms or remove players.
- Bell icon right to players name indicate that players alarm is set or not.
- If you add new players to shortlist, just refresh shortlist page and click to icon again to load new players.
